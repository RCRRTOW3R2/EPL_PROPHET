EPL PROPHET - UPCOMING MATCHES PREDICTOR
========================================

Predict future EPL matches using our 53.7% champion model!

Example: "Man City vs Liverpool tomorrow" 
- Loads latest team form data
- Calculates all our champion features (logarithmic ratios, EMAs, etc.)
- Makes explainable prediction with SHAP

This is what you wanted - dynamic future predictions!
