# EPL PROPHET - Data Standardization Summary

## ✅ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

We have successfully standardized **4,191 EPL matches** across **12 seasons** (2014-15 through 2025-26) into a clean, consistent format ready for your Prophet forecasting system.

---

## 📊 **What We Standardized**

### **1. Schema Alignment**
- ✅ **Unified column structure** across all seasons (older seasons had different betting odds columns)
- ✅ **Core match data**: Results, goals, half-time scores, referee, date/time
- ✅ **Match statistics**: Shots, shots on target, corners, fouls, cards, offsides
- ✅ **Betting odds**: Market averages, Bet365, Pinnacle across 1X2, over/under, Asian handicap
- ✅ **Missing data handling**: Intelligent defaults and derived calculations

### **2. Team Name Normalization**
- ✅ **Standardized naming**: "Man City" → "Manchester City", "Man United" → "Manchester United"
- ✅ **Historical teams**: Proper names for relegated/promoted teams (Cardiff City, Hull City, etc.)
- ✅ **Consistent across seasons**: Same team name format throughout all 12 seasons

### **3. Date/Time Parsing**
- ✅ **Consistent datetime format**: All matches parsed to standard datetime objects
- ✅ **Chronological ordering**: Matches sorted by date for time-series analysis
- ✅ **Time handling**: Default kickoff times for older seasons missing time data

### **4. Core Variable Extraction**

**Results & Outcomes:**
- `FTHG`, `FTAG`, `FTR` (full-time results)
- `home_win`, `draw`, `away_win` (binary indicators)
- `total_goals`, `goal_difference`, `over_25_goals`

**Match Statistics:**
- `HS/AS` (shots), `HST/AST` (shots on target)
- `HC/AC` (corners), `HF/AF` (fouls)  
- `HY/AY` (yellow cards), `HR/AR` (red cards)
- `HBP/ABP` (booking points: 10 = yellow, 25 = red)

**Derived Analytics:**
- `home_shot_accuracy`, `away_shot_accuracy`
- `home_xg_simple`, `away_xg_simple` (basic xG approximation)
- `total_cards`, `total_fouls` (match intensity metrics)

### **5. Market Odds → Implied Probabilities**
- ✅ **Market average probabilities**: `market_avg_prob_home/draw/away`
- ✅ **Bet365 probabilities**: `bet365_prob_home/draw/away`  
- ✅ **Pinnacle probabilities**: `pinnacle_prob_home/draw/away`
- ✅ **Overround removed**: Normalized to sum to 1.0 (removes bookmaker margin)
