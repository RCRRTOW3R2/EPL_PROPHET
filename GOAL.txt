Project Charter — EPL PROPHET

Objective
Develop a predictive and explanatory analytics system for the English Premier League. The system generates match forecasts, explains drivers behind outcomes, enables scenario testing, and provides dashboards for team performance monitoring.

Scope

Match Forecasting

Compute probabilities of home win, draw, and away win.

Estimate scoreline distribution (mode + tails).

Quantify confidence intervals for predictions.

Feature Attribution

Decompose predictions into key drivers: form (rolling xG), Elo gap, rest days, home advantage, injuries/suspensions, and betting market comparison.

Provide SHAP-style contribution plots and auto-generated narratives.

What-If Analysis

Simulate changes in rest, player availability, and venue.

Show resulting shifts in probabilities.

Team Strength Dashboards

Track attack/defense indices relative to league average.

Visualize rolling 10-game trends.

Benchmark each opponent against EPL median.

Communication Templates

Standardized per-fixture output:
• Win probabilities
• Top drivers (positive/negative)
• Comparison with market odds
• Narrative summary

Deliverables

Forecast engine with probability outputs.

Attribution module with SHAP-style visuals.
